description: Comprehensive testing for Better Convex ORM - both type-only tests (compile-time verification with Equal<>/Expect<>) and runtime tests (convex-test library). Use when (1) Testing ORM types (InferSelectModel, query results), (2) Writing runtime tests for Convex functions with Ents/edges/rules, (3) Need Drizzle-style type testing patterns, (4) Testing Better Convex type system specifics (_id as GenericId, nullable conventions)
