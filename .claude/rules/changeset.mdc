# Changeset Writing

Follow @packages/better-convex/CHANGELOG.md writing style. We're still in v0, so use minor for breaking changes, and patch for the rest.

**User-focused, not technical:**

- Describe what users can DO now, not implementation details
- NO internal function names, file paths, or algorithms
- Show before/after or file structure examples when helpful
- Keep it concise - 2-5 lines max
