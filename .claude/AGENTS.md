- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected
- ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion tool when asking questions to the user
- After any package modification, run `bun --cwd packages/better-convex build`, then touch `example/convex/functions/schema.ts` to trigger a re-build
- When using Ralph Loop, use local `/ralph` command instead of `/ralph-loop` (fixes shell escaping bug in upstream plugin)

## PR Comments

- When tagging Claude in GitHub issues, use '@claude'

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

## Browser Testing

- Use `agent-browser` for all browser automation
- Never close agent-browser
- Use `--headed` unless asked for headless
- Port 3005
- Do NOT use next-devtools `browser_eval` (overlaps with agent-browser)
- Use `bun convex:logs` to watch the Convex logs
