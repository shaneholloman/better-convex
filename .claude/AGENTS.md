- In all interactions and commit messages, be extremely concise and sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision
- ALWAYS read and understand relevant files before proposing edits. Do not speculate about code you have not inspected
- ALWAYS use AskUserQuestion tool when asking questions to the user
- When using playwriter, never close pages and ask user to start dev server if needed
- When playwriter browser disconnects, use AskUserQuestion: (1) I connected the extension (2) Skip browser test

## GitHub

- Your primary method for interacting with GitHub should be the GitHub CLI.

## Plans

- At the end of each plan, give me a list of unresolved questions to answer, if any. Make the questions extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.
