## Overrides (apply to ALL commands above)

**plan:**

- Final checklist/acceptance criteria: include test-browser if any browser-based features

**deepen-plan:**

- Context7: only query when not covered by skills

**work:**

- Task loop: For UI tasks, run test-browser BEFORE marking complete (don't guess - verify visually)
- Never mark UI task complete without browser verification

**review:**

- performance-oracle: don't over-engineer, ship fast, keep simple

**feature-video:**

- Prefer PR comment over description update if PR already open
